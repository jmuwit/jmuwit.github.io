    "This application allows you to create and work with documents that combine code, text, data and other types of content.  It is commonly used by data scientists and others who work with data and machine learning.  I believe it is primarily used with Python, but it supports over 40 programming languages.\n",

    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">Markdown</a> is a simple language for formatting text.  This cell is a **markdown** cell.  If you double-click in the cell, you will see the markdown *code*, and if you click the **Run** button in the toolbar above, the notebook will read the markdown and format the cell. *Try it!*\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell contains *code* (programming language text) which can be *run* (executed) using the same **Run** button above.  The default configuration for a Jupyter notebook is using *Python* - you must set it up specially for other programming languages.\n",

    "The type of each cell can be selected using the dropdown menu in the toolbar.\n",

They can also all be run one after another, in order, at once, using the double-arrow button in the toolbar.
