### Customize It!

### Here are some common LaTeX commands:

`\textbf{sentence}`: Makes text bold. For example, `\textbf{sentence}` displays `sentence` in bold.

`\textit{text}`: Makes text italic. For example, `\textit{Experience}` displays `Experience` in italics.

`\section{text}`: Creates a new section with the specified title. For example, `\section{Education}` creates a section titled `Education`.

`\subsection{text}`: Creates a subsection under the current section. For example, `\subsection{Degree}` adds a subsection titled `Degree`.

`\begin{itemize} ... \end{itemize}`: Creates a bulleted list. For example:

```
\begin{itemize}
  \item Item 1
  \item Item 2
  \item Item 3
\end{itemize}
```

`\begin{enumerate} ... \end{enumerate}`: Creates a numbered list.

LaTeX's straightforward syntax is easy to learn and can help elevate your documents. Give it a try and see the difference it can make in your job search!
